## How does it were made

As mentioned, this was my first Frontend Mentor challenge and in spite of the simplicity, for a beginner is easy to make HTML Validation, optimization, organization and accessibility issues.

Fortunately, time has passed and I've fixed (the most of) them.

### Requirements

The only requirement for this solution to be accepted is: it need to work and be responsive.

### Tech

The solution was achieved with only **HTML** and **Sass**, using the **BEM** methodology.

### Forking it

If you want to fork it and create your own project using it as a base one, be free to do it right now!

Unfortunately, I won't be accepting pull requests in this repo because it need to be an demonstration of my work only.

### Compiling

In order to make the styles work, you will need to compile all the Sass files into the `dist` folder. You can make it with the compiler you want, I personally like to use the [Live Sass Compiler Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass), avaliable in VSCode.

But you can try to learn about the [`npm compile-sass`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compile-sass) feature from NodeJS.
